1. What is an interface in Java?

In the Java programming language, an interface is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types.

An interface can be thought of as a contract, where the class implementing it has to implement the methods outlined in the interface.

---------------------------------------------------------
2. What is the difference between abstract class and interface?

A class can only extend one Abstract Class, while it can implement as many Interfaces as needed.
All methods in an interface are implicitly public. 
An abstract class is used when there are some common features to be shared by all objects.
An interface is used when all the features are to be implemented differently.

---------------------------------------------------------
3. What must a class do to in order to implement an interface?

It needs to include an implements clause in the class declaration.
As well as to implement all abstract methods contained in the interface.

-------------------------------------------------------------
4. What is abstract method?

An abstract method is a method that is declared without an inplementation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
5. Can you instantiate an interface?

No, but a reference variable of type interface can be created. Any object assigned to it must be an instance of a class that implements it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Can you declare constructor inside an interface? If not why?

No you can't. A constructor is a method that is called when an object is instantiated. We can't instantiate an inerface and therefore there is no use for a constructor.

------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Can we override an interface method with visibility that is not public?

No we can't. We will receive a compiler error advising that we cannot reduce the visibility.
